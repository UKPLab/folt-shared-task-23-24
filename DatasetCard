Dataset description
  This dataset contains 850 annotated LLM answers for 130 CCAs. For each CCA, we collect five answers from different LLMs (Llama-2-70b-chat with two different system instructions, OpenAI ChatGPT, Microsoft BingChat, and PerplexityAI). It is important to note that some LLM responses have multiple annotations, contributed by different team members.
