This repository contains a dataset with donated annotations from the participants of a shared task that we organized at the Foundations of Language Technology (FoLT) course in 2023/2024 at the Technical University of Darmstadt, which focuses on evaluating the output of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating harmful answers to health-related clinical questions. Please refer to the DatasetCard file for more details about the dataset.
